The UnitedWed plugin allows pros to manage their portfolio directly on WordPress
 
== Description ==

UnitedWed gives couples free wedding planning tools and allows them to get in contact with the best pros who are 
in their price range, in their area, and are available for their wedding, all in realtime. If you are a wedding
professional and you would like to be connected to high-quality leads, come visit us at `https://unitedwed.co`

This plugin allows you to manage your portfolio from your WordPress site at the same time as you're 
freshening up your own site.  When uploading your new photos, you will find a checkbox in the Media Library that 
says:

* Add to UnitedWed

Check those boxes if any of them apply.  

That's it!  If you've set it up in the app, that's all you need to do.
 

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.
 
e.g.
 
1. Upload `uwp-wpplugin.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. In your Media Library, when viewing your uploaded photos, check the `Add to UnitedWed` box as necessary
 

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
 
= Do I need a UnitedWed account? =
 
Yes, you'll need a Pro account with at least an `Associate Membership` on the platform for this to be useful for you.
 
= Do I need releases for the photos I use on the platform? =
 
Yes. You should already have a release for the photos you have on your website.  You just need to make sure there's a clause there that
allows third parties to use them.  To be clear, you're not assigning ownership of the photos to us, you're allowing us to use them on 
the UnitedWed platform.
